Weka exception: Unable to determine structure as arff (Reason: java.io.IOException: premature end of file, read Token[EOF], line 1).

General options:

-h or -help
	Output help information.
-synopsis or -info
	Output synopsis for classifier (use in conjunction  with -h)
-t <name of training file>
	Sets training file.
-T <name of test file>
	Sets test file. If missing, a cross-validation will be performed
	on the training data.
-c <class index>
	Sets index of class attribute (default: last).
-x <number of folds>
	Sets number of folds for cross-validation (default: 10).
-no-cv
	Do not perform any cross validation.
-force-batch-training
	Always train classifier in batch mode, never incrementally.
-split-percentage <percentage>
	Sets the percentage for the train/test set split, e.g., 66.
-preserve-order
	Preserves the order in the percentage split.
-s <random number seed>
	Sets random number seed for cross-validation or percentage split
	(default: 1).
-m <name of file with cost matrix>
	Sets file with cost matrix.
-toggle <comma-separated list of evaluation metric names>
	Comma separated list of metric names to toggle in the output.
	All metrics are output by default with the exception of 'Coverage' and 'Region size'.
	Available metrics:
	Correct,Incorrect,Kappa,Total cost,Average cost,KB relative,KB information,
	Correlation,Complexity 0,Complexity scheme,Complexity improvement,
	MAE,RMSE,RAE,RRSE,Coverage,Region size,TP rate,FP rate,Precision,Recall,
	F-measure,MCC,ROC area,PRC area
-l <name of input file>
	Sets model input file. In case the filename ends with '.xml',
	a PMML file is loaded or, if that fails, options are loaded
	from the XML file.
-d <name of output file>
	Sets model output file. In case the filename ends with '.xml',
	only the options are saved to the XML file, not the model.
-v
	Outputs no statistics for training data.
-o
	Outputs statistics only, not the classifier.
-do-not-output-per-class-statistics
	Do not output statistics for each class.
-k
	Outputs information-theoretic statistics.
-classifications "weka.classifiers.evaluation.output.prediction.AbstractOutput + options"
	Uses the specified class for generating the classification output.
	E.g.: weka.classifiers.evaluation.output.prediction.PlainText
-p range
	Outputs predictions for test instances (or the train instances if
	no test instances provided and -no-cv is used), along with the 
	attributes in the specified range (and nothing else). 
	Use '-p 0' if no attributes are desired.
	Deprecated: use "-classifications ..." instead.
-distribution
	Outputs the distribution instead of only the prediction
	in conjunction with the '-p' option (only nominal classes).
	Deprecated: use "-classifications ..." instead.
-r
	Only outputs cumulative margin distribution.
-xml filename | xml-string
	Retrieves the options from the XML-data instead of the command line.
-threshold-file <file>
	The file to save the threshold data to.
	The format is determined by the extensions, e.g., '.arff' for ARFF 
	format or '.csv' for CSV.
-threshold-label <label>
	The class label to determine the threshold data for
	(default is the first label)
-no-predictions
	Turns off the collection of predictions in order to conserve memory.

Options specific to weka.classifiers.bayes.NaiveBayes:

-K
	Use kernel density estimator rather than normal
	distribution for numeric attributes
-D
	Use supervised discretization to process numeric attributes

-O
	Display model in old format (good when there are many classes)

-output-debug-info
	If set, classifier is run in debug mode and
	may output additional info to the console
-do-not-check-capabilities
	If set, classifier capabilities are not checked before classifier is built
	(use with caution).
-num-decimal-places
	The number of decimal places for the output of numbers in the model (default 2).
-batch-size
	The desired batch size for batch prediction  (default 100).
