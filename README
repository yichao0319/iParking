## Data Placement
## ===========================
- iParking
  |- data
  |   |- sensor: [Input] Data_*.txt and label_*.txt
  |   |          [Output] Preprocessed data
  |   |
  |   |- model: [Output] learned models
  |   |- ml_weka: [Output] prediction and results
  |   |   |- err: [Output] Plot FN/FP cases
  |   |   |- prob: [Output] Confidence of True/False/FP/FN cases
  |   |   |- summary: [Output] Summarized results (to plot figures in paper)
  |   |
  |   |- feature_dist: [Output] feature distribution across months
  |   |- condor: [Output] cluster results
  |
  |- git_repository: download from git repository


## ===========================
## Preprocessing
## ===========================

Step 1. setup_files.sh
  Cleanup old files, setup proper directory, and copy data/labels to iParking/data/sensor/

Step 2. batch_format_convert_libsvm_mat.sh
  Convert libsvm format data to csv format (with both original and normalized feature data)

Step 3. feature_dist.m
  Plot the distribution of each feature across months. It's used to manually get rid of  features which change a lot over months.

Step 4. fix_labeling.m
  There might still offset between the ground-truth and labels. The code tries to fix them by checking the peaks of feature 7 and labels.

Step 5. batch_format_convert_mat_arff.sh
  Convert csv format to ARFF (for Weka) format.

Step 6. weka_filter_resample.sh
  Performs the following tasks:
  a) Remove or keep bad features found in "Step 2"
  b) Attach data from different months
  c) Balance positive and negative samples by calling weka's resampling function


## ===========================
## Classification -- Weka
## ===========================

Step 1. batch_eval_condor.sh
  Run classifiers with various feature selectors/parameters on UT Austin CONDOR

Step 2 (a). summarize_results.py
  Summarize and compare classifieres/Feature Selectors/Parameters from "Step 1" results

Step 2 (b). visualize_err.py
  Plot FP/FN cases from "Step 1" results
